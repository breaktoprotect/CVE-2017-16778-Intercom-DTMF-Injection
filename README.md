# Invoking DTMF Tones for Physical Access Grant on Undisclosed Lift Intercom System (CVE-2017-16778)
## Brief description
A Fermax intercom product was found to be vulnerable to an authorization bypass attack via Dual-tone Multiple Frequencies (DTMF) tones. Such bypass could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to residential level without proper approval or knowledge of the residential unit owner. All restricted floors could possibly be accessed if said Intercom is integrated with the elevator.
Fermax has since remediated this on affected product lines.
